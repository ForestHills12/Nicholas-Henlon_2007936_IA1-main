    <center><h3>Twelve Pillars</h3></center>
    <p>
        <i>Twelve Pillars</i> is a novel of a young man who is unsure of which direction he wishes to go towards in his life.
        The novel is about experiencing the important things in lif while striving towards improvement of one self. In accordance with the 
        title of the novel there twelve "pillars", or life lessons that are presented in each chapter to help guide its' readers on their
        journey towards building a better future.<br><br>

        Throughout chapters four to seven the main message I gathered was the importance of setting a goal and the journey to that
        goal. Goal setting is deciding where you want to go and then designing a plan to get you there. There are often times when you set
        a goal but dont want to get of your comfort zone which will curb you from the original objective you have set out to
        accomplish.
        <br><br>

        There are moments when make a decison we regret or times when a decison wasn't made. In order to reach the goals
        we make for ourselves we should always be prepared to take the best oppertunity that aligns with our goals.
        <br><br>

        Be aware of the people you are around where they are taking you. Successful people look for relationships with other successful people who will push them, challenge them, and encourage them to become better. To attract attractive people, you must be attractive.  
        Not physically but mentally and who you are.
